# LSTM-Climate-Forecasting-Model

This project uses an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network to predict future climate data, such as temperature, rainfall, or other environmental metrics, based on historical time-series data. The model is specifically designed to capture sequential patterns in climate data and provide accurate forecasts for decision-making and research
